## Simple Pokedex App! 

# Description of project
I created a Pokedex for Career Foundry's Full Stack Web Development course. It features a list of 150 Pokemon buttons with loaded data from a public API and a styled modal that pops up when you click on a pokemon. I coded the modal from scratch to look like a Gameboy Color. 

The project also includes a search bar in the navigation.
